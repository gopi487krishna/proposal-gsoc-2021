**Programming Interests**

C++ has been the daily driver for all my needs. I am quite comfortable working and experimenting with C++. Apart from C++ I also love working in C#, Python, RUST and Visual Basic

**Reason for Contributing to Boost Libraries**

I am a C++ fanboy and one of the reasons is simply Boost libraries. Here are some of the reasons why I love Boost Libraries
- Exceptional Code Quality
- Purely Open Source
- Flexible/Adaptable design
- Gold Class Industry Standard
- Influenced many of the libraries and features in the standard 

Boost has been one of the main influencers in the development of modern C++ and it is my honour and pride if I can become a part of developing this beautiful language (C++) and its ecosystem.

**Have you done any previous work in this area before or on similar projects?**

Yes. One of my early projects was developing a pseudo programming language called GML. It is a push parser(I didn't know that back then). I started that language as an experiment to avoid the massive amount of typing that was present in markup languages such as SGML and XML. But eventually, I understood that many decisions of XML are there due to its design which has a lot of advantages. Apart from that I also wrote a FITS parser for parsing the FITS files for the Boost. Astronomy project last year which we intend to submit for review by the end of this year.

**What are your plans beyond this Summer of Code time frame for your proposed work?**

I believe that **Boost.XML** is a very vast project. There are several aspects of this library and during the GSOC period, we are tackling just one of the aspects of this project.

At the end of GSOC, I believe that we will have a low-level parser that will act as the foundation for all the features and tools that will be added/proposed later to the Boost.XML project. 

After completing GSoC, I would fine-tune the existing low-level parser and continue my research on the further development of the Boost.XML project and propose the designs and prototypes to my mentor for features such as (example)

- Validating XML Processor
- DOM support
- Improving the handling of Unicode characters


**Please rate, from 0 to 5 (0 being no experience, 5 being expert), your knowledge of the following languages, technologies, or tools:**


-   C++ 98/03 (traditional C++) : 4
-   C++ 11-20 (modern C++)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :  3
-   C++ Standard Library&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: 4 
-   Boost C++ Libraries&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: 3
-   Git&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: 4

**What software development environments are you most familiar with (Visual Studio, Eclipse, KDevelop, etc.)?**

**Windows Platform :** Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, CLion 

**Linux Platform&emsp;&emsp;:** Visual Studio Code

From my 6th grade I have been a big fan of Visual Studio but this year I decided to migrate my dev env to Visual Studio Code. In VS code I usually develop inside a container ( to avoid dependency problems, unnecessary environment setup, managing multiple versions), etc. Building a project scaffolding is nowadays very simple due to containerized development. Just create a folder open in a container that uses my custom cpp-base image and boom, I have a new dev environment will all the base packages, libraries, tools, etc (Boost,vcpkg,...)

**What software documentation tool are you most familiar with (Doxygen, DocBook, Quickbook, etc.)**

I am quite familiar with Doxygen, Sphinix etc. I love building the documentation using doxygen and then using Sphinix with exhale to generate beautiful documentations. 

Earlier I only used Doxygen with Morsa MCSS framework to generate beautiful and clean documentation but it was quite hard to work with. This is the reason why I moved onto sphinix with exhale for generating documentation for the project.
